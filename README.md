# Project Pegasus
Engine


Pegasus is an upcoming two dimensional top/down pony rpg engine. This is a pet project of mine, inspired by the likes of PonyTown. This project is not a finished video game. Although I have very tenative plans to take it as far as I possibly can. All of the source will be and is free to take, and incorporate into your own projects. The engine will be desinged with as much modularity as possilble. Project Pegasus will be desinged to act as a sort of fandom "RPG Maker" instead of an actual standalone game. 

All I ask in terms of lisencing, is that if you use this source -- or engine -- to create your own project; that you fairly attribute this project. (e.g. keeping the attribs in the header files, or adding credits)
Furthermore, all of the source content in this project must remain publicly availble.
